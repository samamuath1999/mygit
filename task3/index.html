<h4>Here are Ragnar’s last words: “It gladdens me to aknow that Odin prepares for a feast. Soon I shall be drinking ale from curved horns. This hero that comes into Valhalla does not lament his death. I shall not enter Odin’s hall with fear. There I shall wait for my sons to join me. And when they do, I will bask in their tales of triumph. The aesir will welcome me. My death comes without apology. And I welcome the Valkyries to summon me home.”</h4>
